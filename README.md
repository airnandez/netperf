# netperf â€” a minimalistic tool for measuring network data transfer performance in Go

## Overview
`netperf` is an experimental, minimalistic, command line tool to measure performance of transferring data over the network.

It is intended to understand the penalty (if any) of developing data transfer tools in Go, as compared to tools developed in lower level languages, such as [bbcp](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/) or [iperf](http://software.es.net/iperf/). It may also be useful for comparing the performance of exchanging data using different network protocols, such as raw TCP, TLS, HTTP(S), WebSockets, etc. under the same network conditions (e.g. bandwidth, latency, packet loss, etc.).

It consists of a client and a server. The server listens for network connections from clients (current only TCP and TLS are implemented). The client connects to the server and sends data during a specified period of time, using one or more network streams. After the data exchange period is finished, both the client and the server report on the observed throughput.

## How to use
First, start a receiver for receiving data over TCP connections:

```bash
$ netperf receive -addr :5678
```

Then, start a client for sending data to the server launched in the previous step, during one minute, using 2 TCP streams:

```bash
$ netperf send -addr localhost:5678 -duration 1m -parallel 2
netperf: duration:                       1m0.000074495s
netperf: streams:                        2
netperf: data volume:                    299048.88 MiB
netperf: aggregated throughput:          4984.14 MiB/sec
netperf: avg/std throughput per stream:  2492.07 / 53.90 MiB/sec
```

This is the synopsis of the command:

```
$ netperf
USAGE:
    netperf receive [options]
    netperf send [options]

    netperf -help
    netperf -version

Use 'netperf -help' to get more detailed usage information.
```

For getting details on available options for each subcommand do `netperf send -help` or `netperf receive -help`.

## Installation
To **build from sources**, you need the [Go programming environment](https://golang.org). Do:

```
go get -u github.com/airnandez/netperf
```
